## The issue

Following publication, it was established that a bug in the code removed all the zeros from certain datasets (70 datasets, 88 studies in the richness model; 74 datasets, 90 studies in the abundance model; and 42 datasets, 51 studies in the biomass model). NOTE: The affected datasets were often present in multiple models, and most datasets only lost a relatively small amount of zeros. However, 27 studies used in the richness model, 20 studies used in the abundance model, and 9 studies in the biomass model doubled in size when the zeros were replaced. 

The maps in Figure 1 show the extent of the issue. On the right hand side, the maps show only the studies that had zeros removed, with the size of the circle representing the number of zeros that were removed from the original analysis.

On the whole, the results of the re-analysis are similar to the original paper. The following three points summarize the key consistencies/changes for the main results of the paper:

1. The general biodiversity patterns in the three maps have stayed relatively consistent. Of the three global maps, the species richness patterns change the most. The bias, with northern American studies having the largest number of zeros removed, is mostly why the species richness results change. The model now fits better in the northern USA/Canada, and the predictions in certain parts of Europe are also likely based on the North American data. The same also applies for the global map of abundance.

2. The global estimates are, overall, lower than previously. This can be seen with the changes in the scale of the maps, and the mean estimates (in the text). 

3. The message that climate is the most important driver of earthworm diversity stays the same. However, there are some changes to the importance of the different themes. 

This document goes through all the conclusions/results from the paper, and highlights if/how they have changed. Previous figures as well as updated (but non-finalised, in terms of format, resolutions etc.) figures are included.

## Main Text - Species Richness

"..one to four species per site across most of the terrestrial surface (mean, 2.42 species, SD, 2.19)"

* mean is now 0.95

* SD is now 0.96

* min 0.007290587, max = 249.52, median = 0.79

* 99% of the pixels are below 4 (species), and 99.9% below 10 (species). 

"Most of the boreal and subarctic regions were predicted to have low values of species richness..."

* Still true, but because of the overall decrease in richness, much more so than previously

"...low local diversity also occured in subtropical and tropical areas, such as Brazil, India and Indonesia..."

* Still true, but because of the overall decrease in richness, much more so than previously

"...earthworm diversity tended to decrease with increasing PET (table S3)."

* This is still true.

"...tropical regions with decomposition rates have fewer soil organic resources and lower local earthworm diversity (Fig 1B and table S3)."

* This is still true.

"High species richness was found at mid-latitudes, such as the southern tip of South America, the southern regions of Australia and New Zealand, Europe (particularly north of the Black Sea), and the northeastern United States."

* These places still have the highest species richness, except parts of Europe (particularly north of the Black sea) and the northeastern United States. 

"Thus, temperate communities could have high local diversity, as seen here, but those species would be widely distributed, resulting in lower regional diversity relative to local diversity."

* Still true as temperature communities have high local diversity, and analysis of the "regional species diversity" (i.e., the number of unique species across latitudinal bands) was unaffected by the bug.

Because of the increase in the number of zeros in the dataset, the previous (standard) mixed effects model with poisson errors was no longer suitable. Instead, I am now using a hurdle model (with random effects). A hurdle model first models the data as presence/absence. Secondly, models the presence-only data (with truncated poisson error structure). For predictions, the coeffecients from the truncated poisson model are multiplied by the probability of presence.


## Main Text - Abundance


"The predicted total abundance of the local community of earthworms typically ranges between 5 and 150 individuals per m2.... (Fig 1C; mean 77.89 individuals per m2; SD 98.94)."

* mean = 20.95

* median = 13.43

* SD = 30.73

* 80% of the pixels are below 35ind per m2, 90% are below 50ind per m2, and 99.8 are below 150 ind per m2.

"...a slight tendency for areas of higher total abundance to be in temperate areas, such as Europe (particularly the UK, France, and Italy), New Zealand, and part of the Pampas and surrounding region (south America), rather than the tropics." 

* This is still true, despite the overall decrease in abundance.

"Lower total abundance occured in many of the tropical and subtropical regions, such as Brazil, central Africa and parts of India."

* Still true, and lower predicted abundances than previously.

## Main Text - Biomass


"The predicted total biomass of the local earthworm community (adults and juveniles) across the globe showed extreme values (>2 kg) in 0.3% of pixels..."

* 0.123% of pixels are now above 2kg

"but biomass typically ranged (97% of pixels) between 1 g and 150 g per m2 [Fig. 1D; median, 6.69; mean, 2772.8; SD, 1,312,782;....]." 

* 97.3% of pixels are now below 150g

* median = 6.161704

* mean =  51.1763

* SD = 4881.2

* Overall the biomass model has improved (less extrapolation across the global layers) with the additional data.

"The areas of high total biomass were concentrated in the Eurasian Steppe and some regions of North America. The majority of the globe showed low total biomass. In northern North America, where there are no native earthworms(13), high density and, in some regions, higher biomass of earthworms likely reflect the earthworm invasion of these regions."

* Still true - the predictions have hardly changed.

"...we expected high biomass but low abundance. However, these patterns were not found."

* Still true


```{r, include=TRUE,  fig.show = "hold", out.width = "350px", fig.align="center", fig.cap=c("Global patterns of earthworm biomass Top panel shows the original figure, the bottom panel shows the corrected verion. The patterns are almost identical"), echo=FALSE}

## Main Text - General

* Total number of sites in entire database = 9212 (originally 6931)

* Total number of Studies in entire database = 224 (originally 228 - four included in original count incorrectly)

* Total number of datasets = 176 (originally 180 - four included in original count incorrectly)

"biomass model (n = 3296) compared to the diversity (n = 5416) and total abundance models (n = 6358)"

* biomass = 4167

* richness = 7386

* abundance =  8677

"Overall, the three community metric models performed well in cross-validation (figs. S3 and S4) with relatively high R2 values"

* Cross-validation results have no visible changes (not presented here)

* Because of the zero-inflation models, we can no longer (reliably) calculate R2.

* MSE values are similar, see Table 1. Previously, all three models were not as good at predicting the higher observed values. However, with the new models, the MSE values/predictions are lower at the 'high' teriles, and are therefore better overall. 

"For all three community metric models, climatic variables were the most important drivers (the “precipitation” theme being the most important for both species richness and total biomass models, and “temperature” for the total abundance model; Fig. 3)."

* Precipitation is still the most important for richness and biomass. 

* For abundance, temperature is no longer as important. Precipitation is more important than it was, and habitat cover is now the most important, although only slightly so.

* Habitat cover has now increased in importance in the biomass model.

* Stronger effects of habitat cover may partly be attributable to climatic conditions driving habitat type, providing additional support for the importance of climate. We stated this indirect effect of climate in the conclusions of the paper.

"We expected that soil properties would be the most important driver of earthworm communities, but this was not the case"

* Still true, soil is still one of the least important drivers across all three models.

"Habitat cover influenced the earthworm community (fig. S5, A and B), especially the composition of the three ecological groups (epigeics, endogeics, and anecics) (fig. S6) (14)."

* We are still in the process of re-running the supplementary analysis. However, it is more than likely that habitat cover will continue to affect the composition.
