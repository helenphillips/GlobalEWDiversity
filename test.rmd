Following publication, it was established that a bug in the code removed all the zeros from certain datasets (70 datasets, 88 studies in the richness model; 74 datasets, 90 studies in the abundance model; and 42 datasets, 51 studies in the biomass model). NOTE: The affected datasets were often present in multiple models, and most datasets only lost a relatively small amount of zeros. However, 27 studies used in the richness model, 20 studies used in the abundance model, and 9 studies in the biomass model doubled in size when the zeros were replaced. 

The maps in Figure 1 show the extent of the issue. On the right hand side, the maps show only the studies that had zeros removed, with the size of the circle representing the number of zeros that were removed from the original analysis.

On the whole, the results of the re-analysis are similar to the original paper. The following three points summarize the key consistencies/changes for the main results of the paper:

1. The general biodiversity patterns in the three maps have stayed relatively consistent. Of the three global maps, the species richness patterns change the most. The bias, with northern American studies having the largest number of zeros removed, is mostly why the species richness results change. The model now fits better in the northern USA/Canada, and the predictions in certain parts of Europe are also likely based on the North American data. The same also applies for the global map of abundance.

2. The global estimates are, overall, lower than previously. This can be seen with the changes in the scale of the maps, and the mean estimates (in the text). 

3. The message that climate is the most important driver of earthworm diversity stays the same. However, there are some changes to the importance of the different themes.
